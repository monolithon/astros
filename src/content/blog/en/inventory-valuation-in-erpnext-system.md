ERPNext provides the capability to handle batch/bundle management. By default, all batches have the same value, but inventory valuation allows you to modify this. The system supports FIFO/LIFO methods for inventory valuation. However, when using the average costing method, it may not yield accurate results even if you perform inventory valuation for each batch because ERPNext updates one batch at a time, leading to inaccurate outcomes.

This article will be further expanded soon.
