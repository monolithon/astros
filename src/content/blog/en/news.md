I created this blog post during the installation of ERPNext, so I'm just modifying it to preserve it for posterity. Yes, it was on April 19, 2020, when I started monolithon.com and began using ERPNext for my personal use. At that time, I started using it in a live environment under a different domain after transitioning from another system. Before that, I had experience with several self-installs and cloud-hosted ERPNext instances, but it was during this period that the final idea I had in mind took shape. And I don't regret it one bit!

In the following posts, I'll share the news, tips, and tricks about ERPNext.
