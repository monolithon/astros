We have been fully focused on our clients, so we haven't really updated our blog or social media pages recently.

In the background, we've been working hard on the site, which has delayed the publication of new content. From now on, we can use the Astro system we love even more conveniently. How? The key is converting the content to Markdown format! This way, we don't have to bother with formatting and writing HTML code; instead, we can easily update the content or write new posts with any Markdown editor, whether it's about ERPNext, Odoo, or any other topic we like.

If you want to start using Astro and don't need our help, we recommend starting with writing in Markdown format and building your website or blog around it. This will make your life much easier in the long run. For example, editing content with VSCode will be much simpler since there are many great Markdown plugins available. Or you can even use GitHub for writing, allowing you to edit content entirely online, which is even more convenient.

We recommend [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/) for its powerful, distraction-free Markdown editing with a user-friendly interface.
