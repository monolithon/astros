<p>The version 13 of ERPNext brought many new features, including the previously introduced revamped user interface and mobile app. One of the new developments is the enhanced ERPNext - Shopify integration. Until now, it was available as part of the ERPNext's core features, but it seems that the development processes have been reconsidered and transformed at the Frappe team, which develops ERPNext. This integration, which was previously an integral part of ERPNext, is now available as a separate "Ecommerce Integration" app on <a href="https://github.com/frappe/ecommerce_integrations" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and the <a href="https://frappecloud.com/marketplace/apps/ecommerce-integrations" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frappé Cloud Marketplace</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>This new app supports Shopify as well as the system called Zenoti, but the latter is not widespread in Hungary, so let's focus on the main features available in the Shopify integration:</p><p><br></p><ol><li data-list="bullet"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span><span style="color: rgb(31, 39, 46);">Syncing orders from Shopify to ERPNext.</span></li><li data-list="bullet"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span><span style="color: rgb(31, 39, 46);">Syncing customer data along with the order.</span></li><li data-list="bullet"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span><span style="color: rgb(31, 39, 46);">[Optional] Syncing sales invoice and delivery note.</span></li><li data-list="bullet"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span><span style="color: rgb(31, 39, 46);">[Optional] Scheduled stock synchronization between the two systems.</span></li><li data-list="bullet"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span><span style="color: rgb(31, 39, 46);">[Optional] Creating products in Shopify from ERPNext and linking the two.</span></li><li data-list="bullet"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span><span style="color: rgb(31, 39, 46);">Changing the status of a Shopify order to "Cancelled" will also change the status of the order to "Cancelled" in ERPNext.</span></li></ol><p><br></p><p>That's all for the new Shopify ERPNext integration.
