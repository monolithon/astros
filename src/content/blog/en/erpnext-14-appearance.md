We have been following the developments of ERPNext as it is an open-source system, and before its release, we had the opportunity to test ERPNext, so we have already tried out many things even before today's announcement, but we have not been using it in a live environment yet. Soon, we will have more experience with version 14, which we will share.

In the meantime, here are some highlighted new or improved areas:

The workspaces/screens are now even more customizable using the drag-and-drop method. This way, everyone can tailor the appearance to their own working style for a more comfortable experience.

The customization of PDF printable documents has been further improved, making it even easier to add, remove, and rearrange fields on printable business documents.

The subcontractor module, mainly related to manufacturing, which was quite limited before, is now much more usable.

The organizational structure can now be easily entered, displayed transparently, and even exported.

The capability for stock valuations has been further refined by allowing batch/lot-specific valuations.

In addition, improvements have been made across various areas, from reporting to scrap management, availability tracking, and much more. It is important to highlight the new, simpler solution for BOM updates as well.

My personal favorite is the tab view, which is a real innovation. With a lot of data and fields on each screen, grouping and navigating between them is not always easy, making these tabs very useful in the future. (This is visible in the image above as well). Congratulations on the new features!

I will also report on the update process soon because it should be noted that what I wrote about earlier, the migration of different units to separate modules/apps, will start with this version and must be taken into account during the update.
