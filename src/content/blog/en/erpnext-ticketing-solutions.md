<p>What does the team behind ERPNext and Frappe offer for this? As usual, they disrupt the status quo, as they did with the first and only free and open-source ERP system. Ticketing systems, support systems, or customer support systems are one of those areas that exploded with the advent of the internet, the dotcom boom, and perhaps together with the e-commerce frenzy. One of the winners was Zendesk, which was very hard to approach, but FreshDesk also gained significant popularity.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/what-is-hd.png"></p><p><br></p><p>What's new on the Frappe and ERPNext front?</p><p><br></p><p>ERPNext has previously offered the ability to manage customer inquiries through the "Issues" interface. This was typically used to handle requests from existing customers. From this, internal tasks (Tasks) could be created and linked to the customer to be assigned to customer managers. The image below shows how it worked, and it still works in the current version 13. Of course, thanks to the flexibility and customizability of ERPNext, it was very easy to expand the basic capabilities with new fields, links to other ERPNext content, or even workflows.</p><p><br></p><p>Okay, that's great, but there's nothing new. Why is this topic relevant now?</p><p><br></p><p>Frappe chose a peculiar way to celebrate. The now 14-year-old Frappe not only opened the code of the entire operational infrastructure of the Frappe Cloud operated by them, details here:</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://github.com/frappe/press" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/frappe/press</a> and <a href="https://github.com/frappe/agent" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/frappe/agent</a></p><p>(AGPL v3.0)</p><p><br></p><p>But, as they needed a suitable ticketing system for the operation of ERPNext and Frappe Cloud, they not only created it for themselves but also made it available for anyone to use on the <a href="https://frappedesk.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://frappedesk.com/</a> website.</p><p><br></p><p>Currently, Frappe Desk is not yet available on the Frappe Cloud, but it is expected to appear there soon since they have also published it here: <a href="https://github.com/frappe/desk" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/frappe/desk</a></p><p><br></p><p>ERPNext and Frappe are unstoppable.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/images/hero-image.png"></p>
