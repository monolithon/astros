## What's exciting about this update?

Until now, there has been a possibility for Workflow creation in ERPNext, but with this new enhancement, the process becomes much simpler. It simplifies the planning and makes the operation more transparent, as visual Workflow design is now available, not just in the form of fields and tables as before. Of course, many things were achievable with the previous method, and the details can be found in the documentation here: [https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/user/manual/en/setting-up/workflows](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v13/user/manual/en/setting-up/workflows)

With the new visual Workflow Builder, as shown in the image below, we can now design the workflow visually:
