In the Hungarian ERPNext knowledge base and manual, we provided some tips for creating printable or PDF documents, and it was clear that creating new documents or converting existing ones was quick and straightforward. Now, Frappe has taken it to a higher level. The previously mentioned tips and tricks are no longer necessary.

The Print Designer is a new Frappe application that allows users to customize and design beautiful print formats with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality. The application provides a user-friendly interface for creating professional-quality print layouts with ease. The possibilities are endless; you can design the print view of any ERPNext document, from delivery notes to purchase orders, and even up to the ERPNext invoice PDF. The latter won't become NAV-compatible due to this, but it can be used with the ERPNext Hungarian invoicing solution developed by Monolithon to create custom invoice templates.

You can access the app from the following repository:
