snippet: This year, the ERPNext conference organized by Frappe emphasized in-person presence, and there was no online broadcast. However, they recorded various high-quality presentations, which will be edited and published later. Once they become available, I will share more information. For now, we could get a glimpse of the presentations on Twitter, as the conference program covered various topics

However, they recorded various high-quality presentations, which will be edited and published later. Once they become available, I will share more information. For now, we could get a glimpse of the presentations on Twitter, as the conference program covered various topics: <a href="https://conference.erpnext.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://conference.erpnext.com/</a></p><p><br></p><p>One highlight was the inclusion of several headless presentations alongside various introductions and feature demonstrations. Another important aspect was that although version 14 broke away from the monolithic development principle, as I mentioned before, it moved towards a module-based development concept: not only do they maintain the concept of ERPNext being a full-featured free and open-source ERP system, but they also structure the modules in a way that they can be used independently. A good example is the HR app presented at the conference, which can be used separately but is well integrated with ERPNext, as well as the Desk (helpdesk, ticketing) system. The third important point is the rapid development of Frappe Cloud and the related information, such as serving 350 million requests per month and the introduction of a new independent server availability. These two aspects demonstrate the reliability of the service and make it worth considering both Frappe and ERPNext alongside Frappe Cloud. Of course, they also presented other new products, such as Gameplan, an internal communication solution, but for now, I'll stick with Discord, as I wrote earlier about ERPNext-Discord co-use.</p><p><br></p><p>Hopefully, I'll be able to share more personal experiences next year.</p>
