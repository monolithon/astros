Handling cookies has not been the complicated part when it comes to informing visitors on our ERPNext website about their usage. The real challenge lies in ensuring that if a visitor does not accept the use of cookies, we genuinely do not use them, and as website operators, we do not have access to certain information. However, this also restricts the options for the visitor, for example, the site may forget products left in the cart, etc.

Therefore, a solution is needed to manage these aspects together, where, as an ERPNext website operator, we can persuade visitors to allow cookie usage, but until they give consent, we do not load these program codes to comply with regulations. Moreover, it complicates matters to provide the option for visitors to enable some cookies while disabling others. This has not been easy in the past, but luckily, there are several service providers who can handle this for us, and it can be successfully integrated into any website, including the Hungarian ERPNext website.

I examined the following cookie management solutions, but instead of providing a detailed analysis, let's get straight to the point:

The quickest and simplest way is to integrate the solution from <a href="https://cookiebot.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cookiebot.com/</a> into our ERPNext website. Although it's just a few clicks, we still have plenty of options to choose from, even in the free version, which is suitable for websites with up to 100 pages. Even after growth, this seems to be the most cost-effective compared to the others.

With this, there's no need to spend time programming cookie approvals through Google Tag Manager. Thanks to the clever user interface, the solution guides the customer on what they "should" do, as they cannot access the content of the Hungarian ERPNext website without acceptance, while still complying with the regulations.

UPDATE:

I replaced Cookiebot with the solution from <a href="https://www.enzuzo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.enzuzo.com/</a> because certain measurements were not working correctly.
