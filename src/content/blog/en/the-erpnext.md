<p>ERPNext is built on the flexible "framework" developed by the ERPNext development team, which is the Frappe framework. In fact, ERPNext is a collection of apps that need to be installed on the Frappe framework. The development of ERPNext was started by Rushabh Mehta along with a few colleagues, and as the company grew, they created the Frappe organization, and the organization evolved and took shape along with the product.</p><p><br></p><p>What is this organization like? I may report on that in another post because it's very interesting how they think about life and work and how they have implemented it at the organizational level based on shared values. But the current post has a specific news:</p><p><br></p><p>ERPNext has only one founder, Rushabh Mehta, who decided to grant the title of co-founder to some outstanding colleagues who have been involved in ERPNext development for quite some time.</p><p><br></p><p>That's why we love ERPNext!</p><p><br></p><p>I will talk about the other values they represent and how they experiment to build a better product and collaboration later. However, it is clearly visible that their primary goal is not to serve the shareholders, and by ensuring their independence, they can keep ERPNext software free and open, which not many can say about their product. Speaking of shareholders, let me add some technical information to this news since few people know that with ERPNext, you can record information about the enterprise's owners, shareholders, and share movements, ensuring that up-to-date information is always available alongside other business data stored in ERPNext.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://docs.erpnext.com/files/shareholder.png"></p><p><br></p><p>At the same time, some interesting and reasonable changes have been made in connection with the development of the product, which I will also report on soon.</p><p><br></p><p>Congratulations to Nabin Hait!</p><p><br></p><p>Source:</p><p><a href="https://erpnext.com/blog/accounting/the-journey-from-an-accountant-to-a-co-founder" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://erpnext.com/blog/accounting/the-journey-from-an-accountant-to-a-co-founder</a></p>
