<p>It's no big secret that the Woocommerce integration was included in ERPNext because Woocommerce is one of the most popular ecommerce solutions integrated into blogging platforms worldwide. But that's only one part of the story. The other part is that the built-in webshop in ERPNext works only under certain limitations. It might be suitable for B2B service providers because they typically have registered customers, or they manually registered them and granted access to the webshop. However, in the B2C sector, it can be annoying that the mandatory registration interrupts the purchase process, and without it, the purchase cannot be completed. Along with the shortcomings in the shopping cart function, this can significantly reduce the conversion rate.</p><p><br></p><p>ERPNext developers are aware of this, which is why it made it to the current roadmap, and there are already developments in this area, details here: <a href="https://discuss.erpnext.com/t/erpnext-roadmap-for-april-2021/73126/3" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://discuss.erpnext.com/t/erpnext-roadmap-for-april-2021/73126/3</a></p><p><br></p><p>The native Woocommerce integration probably satisfies the basic needs, and as part of the core system, it will likely be a long-term supported feature and collaboration. So, this can be an important aspect when choosing business software. However, it's also worth considering that this is just a basic integration that synchronizes products and orders. For those who want more advanced features, they will have to look for other solutions.</p><p><br></p><p>One option is the ERPNext Shopify Connector, but since Shopify is a paid platform, it might not be everyone's preference. Therefore, I would recommend an extended Woocomerce integration developed by an external developer. It is capable of synchronizing product variations and warehouse inventory, and experience shows that it works with the latest v13 ERPNext as well.</p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://github.com/Muzzy73/WooCommerceConnector" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Muzzy73/WooCommerceConnector</a></p><p><br></p><p>ui: There are a few more methods for synchronizing webshops and ERPNext, but I will cover those in a separate post.</p>
