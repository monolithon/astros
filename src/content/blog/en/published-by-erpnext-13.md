<div class="ql-editor read-mode"><p>As with any software release, there are quite a few bugs reported, but it seems that there are no issues with fresh installations. Those who are planning to upgrade from ERPNext 12 might want to wait a bit until the reported bugs are fixed by the developers. Of course, users can also fix and share the code with the ERPNext community.</p></div>
