Disposal in ERPNext can be solved in several ways.

One of the simplest is scrapping during production, because ERPNext handles this by default. But before that, a scrap warehouse must be created where the goods to be scrapped can be moved during production.

The third solution, which is why we write this trick is the following:

As the first case, here we also need a scrap warehouse, but here we do not use inventory or production, but we do a sale at a lower or zero value. :)
