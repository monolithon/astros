<p>With ERPNext, you can create forms, and in fact, you can create forms for almost all the documents available in ERPNext, which you can even display on the ERPNext website. This is not too complicated, but it's not as straightforward as creating a solution with Google Forms, for example. If you are interested in the details of form building with ERPNext, you can find all the important information in the documentation at the following link:</p>

<p>Besides ERPNext, I am also interested in UX design, and although ERPNext is continuously improving in this area, my experience tells me that a one-size-fits-all tool can never perform as well in certain specific areas as a specialized tool. This is where TypeForm, an online form-building software, comes into play for many people. It is widely used because every detail is optimized to encourage people to fill out the forms created with it. Their mission is well-captured in their slogan "It matters how you ask." I can relate to this sentiment. However, TypeForm is not cheap, and its free version comes with significant limitations for users. Therefore, I searched for a form-building solution that is also optimized for mobile and conversion (which here refers to form completion) without such restrictions, providing a user experience similar to TypeForm.

<p>Give it a try if you haven't used any of the mentioned form-building solutions before, and you will quickly realize that you also prefer to fill out questionnaires and forms of this type, as after selecting the options, you don't need to click any further buttons, everything happens quickly and smoothly. The reason I brought up this topic is that in the next blog post, I will actually introduce an ERPNext feature, and you guessed it, it might be related to form building. By the way, here's another argument for using external software: ERPNext is undoubtedly a secure foundation, where we can import all data from any source, and it's worth doing so. However, depending on the usage and the users, the ERPNext interface may not be the perfect connection point for everyone. Another example is a headless e-commerce platform, which stands out from its competitors with its speed and search engine optimization. When built on top of ERPNext, the entire business process remains in one place, where you and your employees actually use ERPNext. Only your customers using the headless e-commerce platform encounter a different face of the same data, but presented in a way that provides them with an even better customer experience and brings you more conversions/revenue/profit. But that's a topic for another time. For now, let's see the ERPNext feature related to form building in the next blog post...</p>
