<p><img src="/wiki-szerű-oldalakat-szeretnék.png" width="1346"></p><p>ERPNext is built on the Frappe framework, where ERPNext is ultimately a collection of apps written for the Frappe framework. As both ERPNext and Frappe have evolved, other apps have been introduced, also built for the Frappe framework. Some of these are stand-alone applications, while others provide additional functionalities to ERPNext.</p><p><br></p><p>One such stand-alone application is the Frappe Wiki: <a href="https://frappe.io/wiki" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://frappe.io/wiki</a>, which can work alongside the installed ERPNext. Its strength lies in the simplicity provided by the Frappe framework. Those who try it are likely to love it. It allows managing public documents or creating internal pages. It is continually being developed, and missing features such as complete permissions management are expected to be added soon.</p><p><br></p><p>If someone wants to use ERPNext without installing additional apps, there are several solutions for creating a wiki-like experience. One of the most straightforward approaches is to use the "Knowledge Base" menu, where you can create public wiki-like pages on your ERPNext site. This is achieved through the "Website Help Article" option:</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/M39Wp5r.png" width="1199"></p><p><br></p><p>What if you want to create non-public content but still don't want to use the Frappe Wiki? In that case, you can use the "Note" feature available in the ERPNext Tools menu, which allows you to create your own private or shared but non-public content.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="/TEBNJj1.png" width="1249"></p><p><br></p><p>Pro tip: Regardless of the chosen solution, you can use a markdown editor as well :)</p>
