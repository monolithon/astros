Unlike the previous mobile app that merely utilized responsive design, which was essentially a wrapped web page, this time it will be renewed as a native app thanks to the ERPNext API. This will enable smoother mobile usability and better utilization of mobile resources, resulting in a more stable and faster performance.

And there's more. The app will work offline, meaning it will function even with weak or no internet connection. It achieves this by handling synchronization in the background whenever an internet connection is available.

However, I should mention one negative aspect, which is expected to be temporary and might not be well-known by many. The client-side scripts have not been implemented in this new ERPNext mobile app yet, but we hope it will be addressed in the future.

Here are some screenshots of the new ERPNext native mobile application (Android).
