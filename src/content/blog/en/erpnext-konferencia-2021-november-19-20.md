<p>The themes of the 2021 ERPNext conference are grouped into four categories by the organizers.</p><p><br></p><ol><li data-list="ordered"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Frappe Framework, the underlying system that powers ERPNext and can also operate independent apps, such as a wiki knowledge base.</li><li data-list="ordered"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Frappe Cloud, a cloud hosting service available for all software using Frappe Framework. A detailed post about this will be published in the Hungarian ERPNext blog.</li><li data-list="ordered"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>ERPNext, the main product of Frappe, which is perhaps the world's most well-known fully open-source and free ERP system.</li><li data-list="ordered"><span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Community, to which both Frappe and ERPNext owe their existence.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>I will provide detailed coverage after the conference, but in advance, it is worth mentioning that there have already been comments in various ERPNext forum topics hinting at changes in ERPNext development, which will hopefully result in an even better product. The themes of the conference also show that the community comes first, and this professionalization, enabling the development of previously unsupported apps, does not affect the business model, which the founder has repeatedly confirmed will remain completely open-source and free.</p><p><br></p><p>The detailed schedule of the online conference with the speakers can be found here:</p><p><a href="https://conference.erpnext.com/conference/2021/schedule" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://conference.erpnext.com/conference/2021/schedule</a></p>
