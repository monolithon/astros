					highlight one function - it can even be used to manage several companies at once, where the company can even be a person.
					Thus, transactions between different structures can be easily tracked using the system. For example, executive wages are
					income as individuals, but costs on the company's side. In this way, personal and corporate finances and their interconnection
					become transparent. But another good example of personal use is the tracking and managing daily, occasional, recurring project
					tasks and tasks. (which may also have an income or expenditure side). In addition to business use, it is also essential for
					personal use to manage documents related to finances or tasks, which is also easy to do in the ERPNext system. Some problems
					in all areas of life for which ERPNext offers a simple solution. The areas covered by other ERPNext and their operation are
					continuously published on the Hungarian ERPNext website, here at monolithon.com
