          <p class="list-disc text-lg leading-7 space-y-5]">
            Nobody likes to wait in line, especially after a long journey. And a guest arriving at a hotel or hostel has usually traveled a long way
            to get to the check-in desk. In both the digital and physical sense, as the "digital journey" begins well before the reservation and
            continues even after checking out. Our common goal is to turn them into returning customers, which we can achieve by gathering feedback,
            recommendations, and reviews, along with offering additional services while ensuring quality service.

          <p class="list-disc text-lg leading-7 space-y-5]">
            With our queue management system, you can eliminate the line not only in front of the reception but also incorporate it
            into the aforementioned digital user journey, differentiating yourself from competitors by offering queue-free check-ins and potentially
            increasing booking conversions. Instead of standing in line, we can seat our guests, which is crucial in this industry, especially after a
            long journey. Waiting time cannot be completely eliminated due to limited reception capacity, but the conditions in which guests wait make
            a significant difference. This is their first personal experience with our brand, and communication is key in every situation. Thanks to
            the queue management kiosk, guests don't have to spend their initial moments in our hostel or hotel in uncertainty and
            discomfort. They already know how the check-in process will proceed and when they can expect their turn. They can use this waiting time to
            their liking, making the customer service more interactive and engaging.

          <p class="list-disc text-lg leading-7 space-y-5]">
            We provide convenience and time to our guests, but we can further enhance the customer experience, which not only satisfies and retains
            customers but also generates additional revenue for us. Guests can enjoy discounts on consumption or avail additional services while
            waiting. All of these actions can be conveyed through the system (on the customer display or via messages). People may be overwhelmed by
            messages, but the open rate for mobile notifications is very high. In addition to calling guests to the check-in counter (on the customer
            display), it can also be done through mobile messages, opening up the opportunity to send further messages while the guest is on-site or
            even after they leave. According to our calculations, the system can quickly pay for itself even without these extra revenues, thanks to
            precise statistics that enable us to evaluate the performance of receptionists and plan capacity. Due to the rapid advancement of
            technology and cost reduction, it's now possible to introduce a queue management system in various areas without a significant investment.
